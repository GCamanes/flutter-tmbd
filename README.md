## App localization

To add localization to the app, we just followed [official documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization).

All assets and fonts are stored in the ```assets``` folder at the root of project.

We also need to specify their presence in the ```pubspec.yaml``` file.
